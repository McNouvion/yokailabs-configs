## Release Process

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with details of the changes under a new version heading.
2. Bump the version number in `package.json` following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
3. Commit the changes with a message like:
   ```bash
   chore(release): v0.x.x
   ```
4. Create a Git tag for the release:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.x.x
   ```
5. Push both commits and tags to the remote:
   ```bash
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
6. (When ready to publish) run:
   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```
   > For local testing, you can still install via `file:` without publishing.
